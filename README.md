<h2>Description</h2>
 
This website enables you to calculate TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) scores for your datasets. TOPSIS is a powerful technique used in Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), where multiple features need to be considered to arrive at optimal solutions.
   By utilizing this, you can efficiently analyze your datasets and make informed decisions. The TOPSIS methodology takes into account the relative similarity of each alternative to the ideal solution and provides a systematic approach for ranking and prioritizing options.
